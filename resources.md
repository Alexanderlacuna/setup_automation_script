### Do backup conversion

 --- something more then rsync. Maybe does incremental backups. Any suggestions?


I've used `borg` before, restoring I got a list of folders I could browse for what I was looking for. For config bits I've used `git` and `stow` together, and recently started trying out `guix home`. I also use `git-annex` for distributed backups.
