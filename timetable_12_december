25/04/2022

- today's aim is to rewrite a correlation without parralel
- add tests
- mostly borrow from the ggca library

- working from 10:00

- implement the spearman and pearson with rust

- implement pearson correlation
    - then do it for computing p_val
-  https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/a28e609e72ed7c47f6ddfbb86c85279a0750f0b7/src/library/stats/R/cor.test.R#L21

2/5/2022

* first design how the file will be


3/5/2022

- fix issue reported by arun
- structure to just work and also filter for Nan values
- make a compilable library


** aim first create a parser
   - what is contained in this parser ??

    - works for pure values without nan's
        - gets the sample name,and trait_name
    - upgrade to find Nan's and do neccessary replacements


** fast float parser
** add more documentation
  ** usage
  ** testing
   ** for example the speed 


*** trying fast parse float - number of rows is 800000 19.03


** extract sample_names ** first row

//we want to have one pass where we remove duplicates
from x_vals and y_vals and also parse to float
//di

//check on creating new object for each

//https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/02/26/const-generics-mvp-beta.html

// add testcases
   // unittests
// update the documentation


// memory usage not to per please fix

20/05/2022

main object: optimizing of the sorter

** primary working on sorting huge datasets

  -  looking at different implementations


// try different examples --> working on external sorting

// writing a file line by line is inefficient ???

=> working of extern sorter  rust

// current implementation of my extern  sorter is slow

//  check this for implementation of multithreading =>https://github.com/dapper91/ext-sort-rs

-  writr to file instead of writing to vec

- make cahnge //have something that works

-  coderbyte is the email https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/coderbyte/FMfcgzGpFzsrsrRwQSCDpbRxLVTDlMxB




22/05/2022

 - working on sorter and writing to file

-  intercept results and create a buffer which writes on overflow

- later look at what is adjustment p value

9/06/22

** try gn2 profile first

** first run gn2

** fix this bug

** today was able to setup things back to normancy


**   working on rust can't solve the error at the moment

** debugging on the error data classes error

** check on what to do next

a) how should we accept the data //raw data or finished product just to
compute

** thinking about things to accomplish to finalize on rust

- does any of the decision affect the final output(timing)

- p val correctness

- top n elements entry point

- extern sorter didn't complete(incomplete)

- final output json or txt file

- String is an example for collection

** start with parsing the initial input

a) we get sample files from the browser

** first think how we deliver the file
** either raw or processed

** relationship btw sample and correlation check now (ordering)


** ordered samples for each missing values to represented with none

** first understand the creation of dataset and relationship of trait samples to dataset samples

9/8/2022

* plan for the day

* finish on lit correlation

* merge correlation

* ask fred to look at the db part plus bons lmdb ask on the progress

* check on queries written by fred'

* fred to lead on correlation -> to give directions

** what can be done correlation towards the goal -:

   - on the rust part do a bit of optimization
   
   - make sure the data is of the right format

   -  json results

   -  feed the data directly with rust

* else on the gn2-gn3 part where majority of things happen

   - should we move everything to gn3?

   -  so many data checking and parsing from db send the data directly to computation


** get better at rust and python learn from others ;arun;bons;fred

** books I need to read;; effective python,rust for rustaceans;;rust books


** get better at rust techniques

** should we do the serialization using  in rust

   * how do you fetch all entire strains

* working on lmdb (connect this to lmdb)

//check for change for multiple tables
//Your UPDATE_TIME is null because you're using InnoDB instead of MyISAM. InnoDB is generally the better choice, but it doesn't support UPDATE_TIM

// at time of inception check for that

//create diff in a table

9/12/22

* how to make this approach

1) pjotr approach
   * api to create all files
   * option to with textfiles and without textfiles
   * api to delete all files
      * delete specific textfile




* work on file inner circle pass files

//compute with textfiles and without textfiles--> easier

10/1/23


* work on textfiles
* api first //

1) never lose your money


11/1/23

* select last update time for innodb

//ask for clarification for which table we use

* maybe first we could start by invoking this once per day  right

//later improve the script to use last modified time


//fetch all probeset freezes
