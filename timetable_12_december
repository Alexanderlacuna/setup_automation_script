setting up things



6/4/2022

see registrar

set up machine

playing around with bashscript

write my own script

7/4/2022

writing my script
look at jgart work

todo:remove rpy2 fro gn2


issue: have issue rebuilding genetwork

setting up my machine(todo:fully automate the process)

look at tissue(not)

look at issue tracker update issues also pick up a task 
update bons via email on what am doing 


8/4/2022

** things to do

1) 9:00  attend advanced lectures

2) play around with tissue

* building gn2 and issue tracker testing update
later collections of traits


*** getting rid of sublime text completely

rpy2-3.4.5.tar.gz causing slow build



** tests 

** famimiliaring with tissue

**jgart quantum computer company

** quantum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography

tissue :repo


** email notification system tissue


** public inbox :https://public-inbox.org/


** look  at rust projects to contribute

** https://git.sr.ht/~ilmu/

https://git.sr.ht/~ilmu/

https://git.sr.ht/~ilmu/

canonical s-expressions

** be more active programming

** update removing sublime from workflow:to fully emacs
9/4/2022

play around with org roam




10/4/2022

- actual code for adding to colletions

- this week try to implement 12+ hours working schedule

- work from 22:45
   - look at the pca issues
   - allocate time for the advanced bioinformatics course
   
   -  find issues for the new week
   - finish on the pr on gn3

- rebuild genenetwork

   -  remove rpy2 from the build so hectic
   
   - try to build genenetwork 3



11/04/2022

-  todo
   - r-ctl is causing building failure so find the substiutes
   -  report too make packages ing gn2 especially rust and rpy2
     causing build errors
   - rewrite for the r-ctl package
   - remove from gn2 rpy2

- same issue facing building gn2 so many dependencies

   -  todo refix the errors for ctl
   -  look at correlation


** first thing is build environment for gn2

** update source links for guix
    -  python-rpy2 ** use one provided by guix
    - ctl

    - send patches to aaron by 2:30
    - python-rpy2 and ctl source

** 14:00 -> 14:30 budgeting things

** task completed at 16:03 try to rebuild genenetwork then
send patch to arun

*8 successfully sent the patches at 16:34


** start working on slow correlation issue:


** work on correlation diangoising till 18:00 on pearsonerrorcoefficient verbose warning
     ** first update the issues on tissue
        ** play around with tissue
     ** look the issue by zac (user)


** copy ssh to new machine issue (trying) till 19:03

** break later reconvene for correlation/bioinformatics
** look at a glance advanced bioinformatics course
** break till 23:00

** yesterday worked from 10:00 to 23:00


12/04/2022


** just work on the issues (make a good documentation)

** read the previous documentation for correlation timeout

** define what is the issue

** create a step by step diagnosis and what needs to be done


** working from 3:15pm

** first update the guix bioinformatics and see if gn2 builds

** test out tissue

** worked till 6:00am


13/04/2022

** look at guix shell (doesn't quite understand)

** arun changes on my patch (learnt a lot)--> relook at the commit

** start magit adoption ** loving it


** (TODO) functional programming
  - advanced functional programming
  - lambda calculus



** close correlation issues
** open new issue with addded clarity


** focused on primarily gem thread closing issues

** work on adnvanced bioinformatics



** attempt the assignments


14/04/2022

* mainly work on  finishing assignments afternoon

** break till 16:00




15/04/2022

- working on genenetwork2

   - close the issues


** my tasks


** not that much report genenetwork
** guix patches for ctl and rpy2
** looked at a bit correlation
    ** closed a bit of issues: 



** from aaron

 -  https://git.genenetwork.org/arunisaac/genenetwork-machines

 - https://gitea.io/en-us/

-- icipe nairobi


** what to hack on over the rweekend:
 - course from advanced bioinformatics
 - effective python (read)


18/04/2022

held up

19/04/2022

- look at library that use rust

- find language
   -  if language
       - find best frameworks

20/04/2022

- first take the courses

- look at the code implementation for rust and python

- bioinformatics till evening


21/04/2022

- work by time
- doing exercises for guix-bioinformatics


22/04/2022

- implementation of correlation with rust
   - parallel computations

- make a step by step on how to implement with rust



25/04/2022

- today's aim is to rewrite a correlation without parralel
- add tests
- mostly borrow from the ggca library

- working from 10:00

- implement the spearman and pearson with rust

- implement pearson correlation
    - then do it for computing p_val
-  https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/a28e609e72ed7c47f6ddfbb86c85279a0750f0b7/src/library/stats/R/cor.test.R#L21

- pure scipy pearsonr replacement
  - https://gist.github.com/xflr6/afb5bf740aa15a6c2a2c8f56cf768b80

- add more tests

** steps taken**

- implemented both pearson and spearman with rust
   - computing p_vals from the above

- add module only for correlations

- add module for tests

- add multiple tests for this

- update gn issues


- implementation for huge datasets
        - how to read from huge datasets
        - read in bytes lazy loading (copy from lib)
	- benchmark

 - filter invalid data missing values (outerscope)


 - implementation of parallel computation



26/05/2022

- add more tests

- implement way to read huge datasets

   * add validators for this(e.g remove null values)


- handle exception

- //aim is to read the csv/text file then compute the correlation for each

 - assertion of errors in rust

- debugging file path in rust

-- for later use :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45882329/read-large-files-line-by-line-in-rust

-- next step is arrange tests

- fix issue of file path


2- modularizing codes

- dealing with file path issues

- attempt on a huge dataset

- build parser for datasets

- break

-  build anaylzer

- work on parser


27/05/2022

 - read and compute correlation for dataset(correlation)

- dataset parsing(parser)


** my report ***

- implementation the unit type correlation
- added the unittests

- added dataset reader/streamer

- modularization of the code

**** what to work on ****

* integration of streamer and computation

* dataset-parser
***

** work from 11:00


27/04/2022


* work on path issues for finding dataset files
* fix for failing tests(not computing correctly)
* dataset parser
