- make a compilable library


** aim first create a parser
   - what is contained in this parser ??

    - works for pure values without nan's
        - gets the sample name,and trait_name
    - upgrade to find Nan's and do neccessary replacements


** fast float parser
** add more documentation
  ** usage
  ** testing
   ** for example the speed 


*** trying fast parse float - number of rows is 800000 19.03


** extract sample_names ** first row

//we want to have one pass where we remove duplicates
from x_vals and y_vals and also parse to float
//di

//check on creating new object for each

//https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/02/26/const-generics-mvp-beta.html

20/05/2022

main object: optimizing of the sorter

** primary working on sorting huge datasets

  -  looking at different implementations


// try different examples --> working on external sorting

// writing a file line by line is inefficient ???

=> working of extern sorter  rust

// current implementation of my extern  sorter is slow

//  check this for implementation of multithreading =>https://github.com/dapper91/ext-sort-rs

-  writr to file instead of writing to vec

- make cahnge //have something that works

-  coderbyte is the email https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/coderbyte/FMfcgzGpFzsrsrRwQSCDpbRxLVTDlMxB




22/05/2022

 - working on sorter and writing to file

-  intercept results and create a buffer which writes on overflow

- later look at what is adjustment p value

** working on producing executable for  rust-correlation


** good newa able to solve the issue

** working on writing to tmp files

** aim to demo one pass computation

// add options for ouput directory

//open concurrent thread to fetch the results



29/05/22


- working on integrating rust-correlation

- debugging gn2 (setup)

- working on generating temp files


30/05/22

- update for today' standup

  * was able to package rust-correlation,rust-gsl and gsl-sys
  * able to call rust correlation from gn2
 
 - today will work on generating tmp files python and return results

 - modify structure to take output dir
 - show initial results page in correlation

 - take top elements

 - (todo) working on correctly


- look at random rust stuff

- working from  15:30

- debugging issue with creating files

- solving issues with file errors


31/05/2022

 - reply to emails ,u*work,time series

- continue working tmp files

- working from 8:00
 - solve ths issue with creating tmp files today

- anaylze correlation vs partial correlation list out the different to

fred

- issue:autogeneration tables/jinja 2 macros repetitive tasks



1/6/22

- working overnight on this

- debugging issue of permission denied  error for files

- adding tests for rust correlation module python

- issue writing to files

- todo:decorator to delete all files generated


- remaining issue is parsing the data i.e from gn2

- fix issues with variables --> design issue api call or library

- do you do the parsing with rust

2/06/2022

- how to call the gn2 code


- chill till 15:00 while backup restores

- site blocker

- add blocker for certain times



- gwriting invoice during the  evening


3/06/2022

- friday invoice



4/06/2022

pass


5/06/2022


fix issue for variables
5/05/2022

- how to call the gn2 code

6/05/2022

- rebuilding the rust dependencies(achieved)

- solve the issue of guix package path

- working during the night

- from 17:50 working on correlation rust



7/05/22

- working on correlation

- later send email to fred

 - do initial setup



8/06/2022

- looking at failing packages python-scipy,python-seaborn,python-sphinx-panels

- building guix from source

- check on commits:https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=cddedb9c5b0b8417a2afcead164040787e6e1cde

- channel and guix pull --- > check on  what pjotr was talking about



** these are optional

** add up transcript


** proposal  submitted
** reading random things in rust

** resolve path issues

** rethink issue about paths -api or library

9/06/22

** try gn2 profile first

** first run gn2

** fix this bug

** today was able to setup things back to normancy


**   working on rust can't solve the error at the moment

** debugging on the error data classes error

** check on what to do next

a) how should we accept the data //raw data or finished product just to
compute

** thinking about things to accomplish to finalize on rust

- does any of the decision affect the final output(timing)

- p val correctness

- top n elements entry point

- extern sorter didn't complete(incomplete)

- final output json or txt file

- String is an example for collection

** start with parsing the initial input

a) we get sample files from the browser

** first think how we deliver the file
** either raw or processed

** relationship btw sample and correlation check now (ordering)


** ordered samples for each missing values to represented with none

** first understand the creation of dataset and relationship of trait samples to dataset samples


todo : take a course on restful api's


10/06/2022

 - todo ask bons how he solved the issue of not loading the databases

 - the issue for _classvar by pj

 - check on pdb by bons
